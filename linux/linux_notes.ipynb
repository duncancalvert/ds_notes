    "## What is Linux\n",
    "* Free, open-source OS started in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. At the time Unix was a popular OS but was costly\n",
    "    * Unix was released in 1970 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Richie at Bell Labs\n",
    "* Linux is the most popular open-source OS in the world, used for most web servers\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3 core components of Linux:\n",
    "* <ins>Kernel</ins>: the core of the OS. When a computer starts up (\"boots\"), either the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) runs. \n",
    "    * BIOS is generally for older systems and UEFI is for newer ones. \n",
    "    * These run a \"bootloader\" that loads the kernel image (a compressed file that gets decompressed and loaded into memory when ran). \n",
    "    * The kernel then initilizes and starts up everything else that is required to run (drivers, software, etc.)\n",
    "* <ins>The system user space</ins>: an administrative layer that handles configuration and software installation.\n",
    "    * Includes the shell or command interpreter\n",
    "    * Includes daemons. Programs that run in the background to monitor subsystems. Daemons run without user interaction\n",
    "* <ins>Applications</ins>: the main use for computers/Linux.\n",
    "    * Allows you to perform tasks\n",
    "    * Editors\n",
    "    * Web servers\n",
    "    * A graphical user interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributions\n",
    "* Different Linux versions packaged by separate orgs or companies. \n",
    "* They all share the same core kernel but the other two layers can be different\n",
    "* Common distros\n",
    "    * Red Hat\n",
    "        * CentOS\n",
    "        * Red Hat Enterprise (RHEL)\n",
    "        * Fedora\n",
    "    * Ubuntu, based on Debian\n",
    "    * OpenSUSE, based on the the SUSE project\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability\n",
    "* Linux is known for being very reliable with high uptimes\n",
    "* It only needs reboots with kernel updates\n",
    "* There is a new process called \"livepatch\" to minimize reboots\n",
    "* Always reboot your servers regularly as part of a maintenance cycle"

    "## Types of Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server Linux\n",
    "* Less software installed so resources are used more efficiently\n",
    "    * This in turn is safer as it means there are less bugs, insecurities, and complexity.\n",
    "* No GUI and related overhead required\n",
    "* Dedicated servers are designed for throughput, reliability, heavy workloads, high traffic, and tuned for server-style tasks.\n",
    "* Types of linux servers:\n",
    "    * Databases\n",
    "    * Web servers\n",
    "    * Email servers\n",
    "    * Application servers\n",
    "* Linux runs well on off the shelf computers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Desktop Linux\n",
    "* Desktop Linux has a GUI\n",
    "* Fedora and Ubuntu both have popular desktop distros\n",
    "* The default desktop for many distributions is called \"GNOME\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mobile Linux\n",
    "* Touch screen interface\n",
    "* Mobile distros:\n",
    "    * The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is the main distro. It's licensed under Apache.\n",
    "    * Ubuntu Touch\n",
    "    * postmarketOS\n",
    "    * Sailfish OS\n",
    "    * Mobian (a mobile version of Debian)\n",
    "* Mobile linux can be difficult to install and lead to bricked phones\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypervisor or Virtual\n",
    "* Involves using virtualization to run one or more copies of linux inside another OS\n",
    "* It shares resources with the \"host\"\n",
    "    * The VM \"host\" controls resources and assigns them to VM clients as needed\n",
    "    * Allows the efficient use of large servers that otherwise would go underutilized\n",
    "* Types of Virtualization\n",
    "    * Type 1 - A physical computer runs a \"hypervisor\" that talks directly to the computer's hardware, usually dedicated to running VMs. Amazon EC2 is an example\n",
    "        * Allows you to build and run huge numbers of VMs at once (i.e. corporate data center, cloud provider, etc.)\n",
    "    * Type 2 - Hosted hypervisor. Software on a normal OS allows you to run a VM on a normal computer like your laptop\n",
    "        * Can only run a few VMs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Architectures\n",
    "* There are different Linux versions for different CPU types\n",
    "* The most common is the x86 64-bit CPU from AMD and Intel (also goes by the names \"X64\" and \"amd64\")\n",
    "* Other examples of CPU designs\n",
    "    * Apple took the ARM64 and created their M1 CPUs\n",
    "    * The ARM64 architecture shows up as aarch64 in Linux\n",
    "    * Risc\n",
    "    * PowerPC\n",
    "* Linux is used in most IT infrastructure\n",
    "    * Network routers and gateways\n",
    "    * Network switches\n",
    "    * Firewalls\n",
    "    * Smart TVs\n",

    "    * <ins>Transport layer</ins>: ensure you're using an encrypted and secure connection. It also caches and compresses data\n",
    "    * <ins>Authentication layer</ins>: ensure you are who you say you are using keys and passwords\n",
    "    * <ins>Connection layer</ins>: maintains and manages the connection once authenticated\n",
    "* <ins>ssh</ins>: a text-based program that supports the above protocol\n",
    "    * Can also be used to transfer data via the \"scp\" command\n",
    "    * Uses a shared key system (public/private key) to connect\n",
