    "Under Org Layer\n",
    "* Org policies are applied to the billing account\n",
    "* The org can have multiple billing accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship to Projects\n",

    "### Control Billing Access with IAM Roles\n",
    "* By limiting who can create new billing accounts and who can link them to projects, you protect cost overruns\n",
    "* <ins>IAM</ins>: Who (Member), can do what (Role), on which resource (Resource)\n",
    "\n",
    "Control Access\n",
    "* <ins>Billing Account Administrator</ins>>: owns the billing account. Manages and assigns access to others.\n",
    "* <ins>Billing Account Creator</ins>>: can create new billing accounts in the org but cannot assign rights to others\n",
    "* <ins>Billing Account User</ins>>: can associate projects with billing accounts. Often paired with the \"Project Creator\" role\n",
    "\n",
    "IAM Access Scopes\n",
    "* Roles can be assigned at different layers. Roles assigned at organization layer are inherited by all attached billing accounts\n",
    "* Best practices\n",
    "    * Follow the principle of least privilege and assign only the necessary permissions to perform the role\n",
    "    * Assign multiple billing account admins to ensure operation BCP (if one admin is unavailable, another can manage)\n",

    "* Able to get a more fine-grained view into billing data in BigQuery\n",

    "### Billing Alerts\n",
    "* Can be setup in the Billing service to automatically alert you\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools to Reduce Costs\n",
    "* Rightsizing VMs - automatically generated recommendations to increase/decrease VMs \n",
    "* Sustained Use Discounts - automatic feature that gives you discounts\n",
    "* Committed Use Discounts - billed monthly for 1-3 years of committment. Billed based on compute, not specific machines\n",
    "* Preemptible VMs - save up to 80%. Max life of 24 hours. Good for fault tolerant, batch compute jobs\n",
    "* Cloud Storage Classes - Standard, Nearline, Coldline, Archive\n",
    "* Cloud Storage Lifecycle Policies - Automatically delete/change class of old data\n",
    "* Free Tier Resources - low usage of many GCP services is always free. "
